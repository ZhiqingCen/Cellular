# Cellular, 1D Cellular Automaton in MIPS

- Manual Conversion to MIPS Assembly:
- Successfully translated the [cellular.c](cellular.c) file into MIPS assembly language, ensuring accurate replication of the cellular automaton logic.
- Demonstrated proficiency in MIPS assembly by manually converting complex logic and control structures from C to assembly.
- Enhanced Assembly Language Skills:
- Gained a deeper understanding of assembly language programming through hands-on implementation of a one-dimensional, three-neighbor cellular automaton.
- Improved ability to optimize and debug assembly code, ensuring efficient execution and correct behavior of the automaton renderer.
